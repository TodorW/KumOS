KumOS
=====

KumOS is a minimalist, (soon-to-be) Linux-kernel–based operating system written in C.
It focuses on simplicity, sustainability, and practical usefulness.

The goal is not feature density, but long-term maintainability and clarity.
Every component must justify its existence.

Mission
-------

* Minimal surface area
* Predictable behavior
* Sustainable design
* Useful defaults
* No unnecessary abstractions

Quick Start
-----------

* Source tree: (TBD)
* Build system: manual, explicit, no automation magic
* Status: early development

Principles
----------

* Simplicity over cleverness
* Explicit configuration
* User control over convenience
* If it can be removed, it should be
* Correctness comes before stability

Scope
-----

Included:
* Linux kernel base
* Minimal userland
* Deterministic system behavior

Excluded:
* Automatic configuration
* Background daemons without purpose
* Redundant layers
* Trend-driven features

Who Is This For?
================

* Developers who want control
* System builders
* Minimalists
* People who read the code

Kernel Base
===========

KumOS is based on the Linux kernel.

Upstream behavior is respected where practical.
Any divergence is intentional and driven by simplicity,
maintainability, or correctness.

License
=======

KumOS is released under the GNU General Public License v2.

Final Note
==========

KumOS is not designed to be friendly.
It is designed to be understandable.

If you value control and clarity, you are in the right place.

Project is still under general reconstruction.
